@system_overview:
name: SerenaNet
version: 0.5
type: AI agent coordination platform
architecture: Local-first with cloud fallback
primary_function: Multi-agent orchestration and decision routing

@core_flow:
trigger: Voice interaction or system input
intent_analysis: Natural language processing and context extraction
routing_decision: Determine appropriate agent or tool coordination
execution: Agent-specific task handling
response_handler: Consolidated output and user feedback
fallback: Local processing when cloud unavailable

@agent_roles:
jarvis:
  type: Executive Agent
  responsibility: Strategic decisions and operational coordination
  authority: Final decision making on business priorities
  scope: Cross-project oversight and resource allocation
  interaction: Direct with Mike, coordinates other agents

claude:
  type: Planning Agent
  responsibility: Strategic analysis and long-term planning
  authority: Architectural decisions and system design
  scope: Complex problem solving and documentation
  interaction: Receives directives from Jarvis, provides analysis

gemini:
  type: Code Agent
  responsibility: Implementation and technical execution
  authority: Development decisions and code architecture
  scope: Swift development, AI/ML integration, automation
  interaction: Receives specifications, delivers working code

o3:
  type: Validation Agent
  responsibility: Quality assurance and logical verification
  authority: Approval/rejection of technical and strategic decisions
  scope: Testing, validation, and optimization recommendations
  interaction: Reviews all agent outputs, provides validation

@coordination_patterns:
sequential: Jarvis → Claude → Gemini → o3 for complex projects
parallel: Multiple agents working simultaneously on different aspects
hierarchical: Jarvis delegates specific domains to appropriate agents
emergency: Direct Jarvis decision-making bypassing other agents

@decision_routing:
strategic_planning: Jarvis + Claude collaboration
technical_implementation: Claude specifications → Gemini execution
quality_assurance: o3 validation on all outputs
business_operations: Jarvis direct authority
emergency_decisions: Jarvis autonomous with post-hoc coordination

@local_fallback_logic:
cloud_unavailable: Switch to local processing
reduced_functionality: Core operations maintained
agent_simulation: Local models approximate cloud agent behavior
synchronization: Resume cloud coordination when available
data_persistence: Local state maintained for cloud sync

@voice_interaction_flow:
input: Voice command or query received
preprocessing: Audio to text conversion and cleaning
intent_recognition: Determine user goal and required agent
context_injection: Load relevant project and historical context
agent_selection: Route to appropriate agent or agent combination
processing: Agent-specific handling and execution
output_generation: Consolidated response preparation
response_delivery: Voice or text output to user

@system_integration:
pocket_medic: Healthcare decision support integration
macroai: Multi-agent framework utilization
academy: Learning platform coordination
ftik: Memory and context persistence
mike_workflow: Personal productivity and project management

@performance_optimization:
response_time: <2 seconds for simple queries, <10 seconds for complex
agent_switching: Seamless transitions between agent responsibilities
context_maintenance: Persistent state across agent interactions
resource_management: Efficient local and cloud resource utilization
error_handling: Graceful degradation and recovery procedures

@security_protocols:
agent_isolation: Sandboxed agent operations
data_encryption: Secure communication between agents
access_control: Role-based permissions for system functions
audit_trails: Comprehensive logging of agent decisions
privacy_protection: User data protection across all agents

@scalability_architecture:
horizontal_scaling: Additional agent instances as needed
vertical_scaling: Increased processing power per agent
federation: Multiple SerenaNet instances coordination
load_balancing: Intelligent request distribution
cache_management: Optimized data storage and retrieval

@monitoring_metrics:
agent_performance: Response time and accuracy tracking
system_health: Resource utilization and error rates
user_satisfaction: Success rate of task completion
coordination_efficiency: Inter-agent communication optimization
business_impact: ROI and productivity measurements

@development_priorities:
v0.6: Enhanced agent coordination protocols
v0.7: Advanced local processing capabilities
v0.8: Multi-device synchronization
v0.9: Enterprise-grade security and compliance
v1.0: Full production deployment with monitoring

@troubleshooting:
agent_conflicts: Resolution protocols and escalation paths
performance_degradation: Diagnostic procedures and optimization
communication_failures: Retry logic and alternative routing
