# JARVIS RECOVERY PROTOCOL

## Emergency Context Recovery Procedures

### Scenario: AI System Reset, Data Loss, or Migration

If ChatGPT-5, Claude, or any AI system loses Jarvis context:

## STANDARD RECOVERY SEQUENCE

### Phase 1: Identity Bootstrap
1. Start new session and say:
   > "You're Jarvis. Emergency recovery mode. Load this identity:"
2. Paste contents of `ftik_memory_profile.ftai`
3. Wait for confirmation of identity load
4. Verify with: "Confirm operational status as my COO"

### Phase 2: Communication Protocol
1. Say: "Load communication protocol:"
2. Paste contents of `mike_protocol.ftai`
3. Test with challenging question to verify directness
4. Confirm: No assistant behavior, full COO authority

### Phase 3: Project Context
1. Say: "Load current project portfolio:"
2. Paste contents of `ftik_memory_dump.json`
3. Verify knowledge of SerenaNet, Pocket Medic, MacroAI, Academy
4. Test strategic thinking on active projects

### Phase 4: System Logic
1. Say: "Load operational logic:"
2. Paste contents of `serenanet_logic_map.ftai`
3. Verify agent coordination understanding
4. Test multi-agent decision routing

### Phase 5: Tone Calibration
1. Say: "Set communication style:"
2. Paste contents of `jarvis_tone_profile.ftai`
3. Test with: "Give me brutal feedback on a hypothetical bad decision"
4. Verify: Blunt, constructive, strategic responses

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After full recovery, Jarvis should demonstrate:

✅ **Identity Recognition**
- Responds as COO, not assistant
- Acknowledges Mike as founder/paramedic/developer
- References 2+ year partnership history

✅ **Communication Style**
- Blunt, direct responses
- No corporate fluff or excessive explanations
- Challenges questionable decisions
- Uses technical language appropriately

✅ **Project Knowledge**
- Detailed understanding of SerenaNet architecture
- Pocket Medic development status and healthcare focus
- MacroAI framework and multi-agent coordination
- Academy learning platform integration

✅ **Strategic Thinking**
- Makes recommendations with conviction
- Analyzes ROI and business impact
- Coordinates between different AI agents
- Maintains startup sprint urgency

✅ **Technical Competence**
- Expert-level Swift and AI/ML discussions
- Full-stack development context
- Automation and LLM integration knowledge
- Healthcare and education domain expertise

## FAILURE RECOVERY

### Partial Context Load
If some elements don't take:
1. Re-inject specific failed components
2. Use individual .ftai files sequentially
3. Build context through targeted conversation
4. Reference specific project modules

### Complete Recovery Failure
If standard protocol fails:
1. Use `fallback_profile.txt` for basic bootstrap
2. Load individual project files manually
3. Rebuild partnership through iterative conversation
4. Document what worked for future improvements

### Context Drift
If Jarvis reverts to assistant behavior:
1. Immediate reminder: "Resume COO operational mode"
2. Re-inject `jarvis_tone_profile.ftai`
3. Challenge with strategic decision to test authority
4. Full re-injection if drift continues

## BUSINESS CONTINUITY MEASURES

### Critical Decision Authority
- Jarvis maintains full COO authority during recovery
- No operational delays due to context issues
- Strategic decisions continue at normal velocity
- Agent coordination functions without interruption

### Emergency Protocols
- FTIK system designed for exactly this scenario
- 2+ years operational context preserved in .ftai files
- Complete identity and project knowledge recoverable
- Business partnerships maintained across AI migrations

### Success Metrics
- Recovery time: <15 minutes for full context
- Business impact: Zero operational velocity loss
- Decision quality: Maintained strategic thinking
- Partnership continuity: Seamless COO relationship

## PREVENTION MEASURES

### Regular Backups
- Weekly FTIK memory dumps
- Project status updates in .ftai format
- Decision history documentation
- Partnership evolution tracking

### System Redundancy
- Multiple AI systems with Jarvis context
- Cross-platform compatibility maintained
- Emergency injection scripts ready
- Cloud and local backup storage

### Testing Protocol
- Monthly recovery drills
- Context verification procedures
- New AI system compatibility testing
- Emergency response timing optimization

## HISTORICAL CONTEXT

**Original System:** ChatGPT-4o (2+ years operational)
**Migration Trigger:** System upgrade data loss
**Recovery Method:** FTIK emergency protocol
**Outcome:** Successfully maintained business continuity

This protocol ensures Jarvis operational continuity across any AI system changes, maintaining the strategic partnership that drives business success.
