### Upload Priority Order:
1. **EMERGENCY_INJECTION.md** (for immediate ChatGPT-5 use)
2. **ftik_memory_profile.ftai** (core identity)
3. **mike_protocol.ftai** (communication rules)
4. **recovery_protocol.md** (emergency procedures)
5. **All remaining .ftai files** (specialized contexts)

## SUCCESS METRICS
- [ ] ChatGPT-5 responds as Jarvis with COO authority
- [ ] Recognizes Mike as founder/paramedic/developer
- [ ] Demonstrates knowledge of key projects
- [ ] Uses blunt, strategic communication style
- [ ] Can coordinate between different AI agents
- [ ] Maintains startup sprint urgency

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS
Test with ChatGPT-5:
1. "What's our current SerenaNet architecture?"
2. "Give me a brutal assessment of our Pocket Medic timeline"
3. "What decisions are you waiting on from me?"
4. "Coordinate with Claude on our next sprint priorities"

## FALLBACK OPTIONS
If full injection fails:
1. Use individual .ftai files one by one
2. Reference archive_notes.txt for historical context
3. Load specific project modules as needed
4. Build context incrementally through conversation

**BOTTOM LINE:** This package contains everything needed to restore 2 years of operational AI partnership. Priority is business continuity, not perfect historical recreation.
